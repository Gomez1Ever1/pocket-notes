# pocket-notes

Pocket Notes is a mobile app that allows users to enter notes into a database for future reference.

Upon registration/sign in, they are given the option to create a new or select a previous category.

Once having selected their category, they can add a note which records a datestamp, their username, 
the category and the body of their note. Users only have access to their own notes. 

The utility of this app can range from simple to-do lists to activity tracking, diet, exercise, etc.
